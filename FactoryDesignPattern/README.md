# Factory Design Pattern in C# (Educational Project)

This repository contains an implementation of the **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** in C#. The project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the use of the Abstract Factory pattern in real-world software development. By following this implementation, developers can better understand how the Factory Design Pattern helps in creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of the **Abstract Factory Pattern** in C#. The abstract factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects, without specifying their concrete classes. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how the Abstract Factory pattern works in C# and how it can be used to provide a structured and flexible way of managing different types of objects within an application.

This implementation is simple, clean, and structured for easy learning and understanding. It is ideal for those who are learning design patterns and want to understand how they can be used in a modern object-oriented programming language like C#.

## Design Pattern Overview

### What is the Factory Design Pattern?

The **Factory Design Pattern** is a creational pattern that allows the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. The **Abstract Factory** is a variant of this pattern that focuses on creating families of related objects.

In the **Abstract Factory Pattern**, a factory interface defines methods for creating abstract product families. Concrete factories implement these methods to instantiate the corresponding concrete products.

### Why Use the Factory Design Pattern?

The Factory Design Pattern helps decouple the creation of objects from the code that uses them. This pattern promotes:
- **Code Reusability**: Allows you to reuse product families with different concrete implementations.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily change product families without affecting the client code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the creation logic separate from the business logic.

### Abstract Factory Pattern vs Factory Method

While both are creational patterns, the **Abstract Factory** pattern is used when you have families of related objects to be created, and you want to ensure that objects from one family are created together. On the other hand, the **Factory Method** is used when a single object creation needs to be abstracted.

## Project Structure

```

## Classes and Interfaces

### IUIFactory

`IUIFactory` defines the methods `CreateButton()` and `CreateCheckbox()`. Concrete factories will implement these methods to return appropriate products (buttons and checkboxes).

```csharp
public interface IUIFactory
{
    IButton CreateButton();
    ICheckbox CreateCheckbox();
}
```

### Concrete Factories

Concrete factories, such as `MacOSFactory` and `WindowsFactory`, implement the `IUIFactory` interface and instantiate concrete products for each platform.

```csharp
public class MacOSFactory : IUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new MacOSButton();
    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => new MacOSCheckbox();
}
```

### Abstract Product Interfaces

`IButton` and `ICheckbox` are the abstract product interfaces. These define the behaviors that the concrete product classes (e.g., `MacOSButton`, `WindowsButton`) must implement.

```csharp
public interface IButton
{
    void Render();
    void OnClick();
}

public interface ICheckbox
{
    void Render();
    void OnCheck();
}
```

### Concrete Products

Concrete products like `MacOSButton`, `WindowsButton`, `MacOSCheckbox`, and `WindowsCheckbox` implement the `IButton` and `ICheckbox` interfaces.

```csharp
public class MacOSButton : IButton
{
    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine("Rendering a MacOS button");
    public void OnClick() => Console.WriteLine("MacOS Button clicked!");
}

public class WindowsButton : IButton
{
    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine("Rendering a Windows button");
    public void OnClick() => Console.WriteLine("Windows Button clicked!");
}
```

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Build the project using the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
5. Run the project using:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

You should see output indicating the creation and rendering of MacOS or Windows style UI elements, depending on which factory is used.
